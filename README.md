## What is EXnSOL?
A package for LaTeX to create exams and worksheets. With the option to mark tasks with a requirement category.

## Disclaimer
This Latex package and its documentation are still under development. **Testers are welcome!**

The package is functional and has been in use by the author for many months. However, it still needs some finishing touches, as there are still some unnecessary macros and probably some parts of the code could still be improved. 
The publicly tested version is scheduled to be released on Ctan at some point, according to the plan.
