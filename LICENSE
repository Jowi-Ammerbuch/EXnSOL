The LaTeX Project Public License
           LPPL Version 1.3c  2008-05-04


Copyright 1999 2002-2008 LaTeX3 Project
Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this license document,
but modification of it is not allowed.


PREAMBLE
========

The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under which the
LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.

You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright and which
you wish to distribute.  This license may be particularly suitable if your work
is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but it is written in such a way that
you can use it as the license for any software.

The section "WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE", below,
gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are
considering distributing their works under this license.

This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed and modified,
as well as conditions under which modified versions of that work may be
distributed.

We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom
to make and distribute modified versions of your work that conform with whatever
technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity,
and reliability of the original work.  If you do not see how to achieve your
goal while complying with these conditions, then read the document
cfgguide.tex and modguide.tex in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.


DEFINITIONS
===========

In this license document the following terms are used:

  Work
    Any work being distributed under this License.

  Derived Work
    Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.

  Modification
    Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law — for
    example, the production of a file containing an original file with
    additions or deletions.

  Distribution
    Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in whole or
    in part.

  Compiled Work
    A version of the Work produced by applying some process to it, so that the
    Work is no longer directly accessible to the user (for example, a document
    produced by running a LaTeX file through TeX).

  Current Maintainer
    A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is no
    Current Maintainer then this is the person or persons who last made a
    Known Version.

  Base Interpreter
    A program that allows the user to run the Work without modification but
    that is not considered part of the Work.  Typical examples include TeX,
    LaTeX, and similar programs.


CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
============================================

1.  You may distribute the Work in a complete, unmodified form provided that
    this license is distributed with it.

2.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a complete
    and unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under clause 1 above, as
    long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that the user can
    re-generate the Compiled Work from a complete, unmodified copy of the Work.

3.  If you distribute a Modified Work, you must distribute it under this
    License, and you must meet all the requirements of this License that are
    applicable to the distribution of a Modified Work.

4.  You must not distribute the Modified Work with the filename of the original
    Work, and you must ensure that the Modified Work is clearly distinguished
    from the original Work.

5.  If you distribute a Modified Work you must include a prominent notice
    stating that you have modified the Work, and the date of any modification.

6.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without restriction,
    permit others to distribute your version of the Work or a Modified Work
    under a different license.

7.  If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should maintain a
    public place that contains a copy of the Work, your contact details, and
    information on how to become the Current Maintainer.

8.  This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the Work
    but are distributed or stored together with the Work.


NO WARRANTY
===========

There is no warranty for the Work.  Except where required by law, the copyright
holders provide the Work "as is", without warranty of any kind, either expressed
or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.  The entire risk as to
the quality and performance of the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove
defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.


MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK
=======================

The Work has the status "maintained" if there is a Current Maintainer who is
willing to receive error reports for the Work and to correct them.

A Derived Work is said to be "maintained" if it is being maintained by someone.


WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE
=======================================================

This section is not normative; it contains examples and recommendations.

If you wish to distribute a work under this license, you should:

  (a) include a copy of this license in the Work’s primary distribution directory;
  (b) clearly state in the README or equivalent file that the Work is
      distributed under the terms of the LPPL;
  (c) state whether the Work is maintained, and if so, give the name of the
      Current Maintainer;
  (d) state how the Work relates to any other work and what files constitute
      the Work.

To produce a Derived Work, you may alter any files of the Work, but you must
not use the original filename.  You should distribute the Derived Work with
a filename that clearly distinguishes it from the original Work.
